cave-blanket.jpg: The size of a coverlet is my ideal for exploring pattern and design.
  The canvas is large enough to play but small enough to manage loom-wise. By constructing
  with panels I can explore variations on symmetry. Often, I spin my own yarn or combine
  hand-spun and commercial threads. This cave echo was woven from hand-spun yarns
  and brown wool.

lost-city.jpg: I found the colors and textures of this weaving in a photograph of
  Angkor Wat. As I worked I listened to a book about English explorers in the Amazon
  who were searching for a lost city of reputation and myth. Most of them died. This
  panel gestures at the dream of a lost civilization covered by silt and time. We
  would not understand its history if we ever found it.
marigold-curtain.jpg: A curtain woven from yarn dyed with marigolds.
natural-dyed-sample.jpg: I hand-dyed a plain cotton yarn from hibiscus tea (pink)
  and black walnut hulls (brown) gathered from a side road in  my parents neighborhood
  north of Detroit. I used these yarns to weave a curtain in panels on an old loom.
  The loom had not been used in a long time; and the yarn left on it had rusted. I
  used that yarn as well. I did not use mordants with these dyes, so over time they
  faded when I put the curtain in a sunny window. I re-dyed the curtain using marigolds
  grown by my mother and a copper sulfate mordant dug out of the back of my parents
  garage. Sometimes it is nice to see what you can do with what is lying around.
